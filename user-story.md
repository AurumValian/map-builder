# User Story

## A user should be able to:

- view the main page
- view a brief description of how the website works
- press a button, where the button will generate an array of lines
- the lines should create an enclosed space with at least one entrance and multiple paths
- there should be "rooms", or open areas, in the array of lines, each with an entrance and potentially one or more exits
- the user should be able to see the map the lines create
- save a map for later use
- print a map
- delete a saved map
